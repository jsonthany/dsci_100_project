    "#### INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Background Information**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most pertinent questions looming over educators' heads worldwide is **what are the most important factors that determine student's ability to learn**. There exist large discepencies in individuals' grades within most schools despite most students receiving the same shared resources (e.g. teachers, books, etc.) within schools, and educational curriculum between schools. Hence, it is important that we look at other factors outside of school that may play an important role determining a student's learning ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing further, we need to make the assumption that grades are good indication of a student's ability to learn; reflecting their ability to understand and grasp the concepts learned in their respective subjects. Although, in reality, this assumption does not always hold, we have chosen grades as our response variable to reflect one's learning ability because it is still the standard measure used in educational institutions worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Question** \n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to our overarching question: **how are each students individual final grades impacted by their family/home backgrounds, individual effort, demography, past academic records, and extra-curricular educational support?** More importantly, understanding not only how, but also measuring the weight / level of impact of each variables, will potentially provide a pathway to improve student's future learning ability. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Description:**\n",
    "The dataset is taken from two Portuguese schools ('GP' - Gabriel Pereira and 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira) and measures several of their secondary student's attributes and their three types of grades (Portugese class grades, Math class grades, and Final grades). The student attributes that were measured include, but are not limited to, the following: school, sex, age, study time, travel time, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that the given dataset only reflects two Portugese schools and is not reflective other schools worldwide (as posed in our project question), but it is indeed a good starting point as we explore answers to the question."
