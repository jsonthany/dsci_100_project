    "Formulate a hyposthesis based on research findings to answer the question: what factors (included in the data set) have the most impact on students' final grades?\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the many different variables measured in the data set, we picked three based on our research that we believe could have significant impacts on students' performance in school. The three variables and our reasoning for picking them are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Parents' Level of Education: Several of our sources noted that parents who attained higher levels of education are likely to encourage thier children to follow in thier footsteps. They are more likely to teach their children to value thier education and to care about thier performance in school, and therefore we predict that students whose parents attained higher levels of education will recieve higher grades. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Amount of Time Spent Studying: We predict that the amount of time a student spends studying outside of class will impact thier final grade. The more time that a student takes to review and think about class material, the more likely it is that they will understand and remember concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Absences: Similarily, we predict that students who are frequently absent from school will have lower grades because they may have missed some of the material that was covered. Also, though there are many reasons that a student may miss a day of school, deliberately skipping school indicates that a student does not highly value thier education, and is likely not to care about thier grades or study in preparation for exams. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use regression tools to compare each of these three variables to final grades for each student, and use the outcomes to determine which variable is the best predictor for final grades. \n"

    "After defining our objectives, we will clean the data and select the relevant columns from the dataset: G3, absences, Medu, Fedu,  and studytime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since mother's level of education (Medu) and father's level of education (Fedu) are in two seperate columns, we will merge them into one column called parent_ed to make our analysis a little easier. We will do this by creating a new column using the mutate function whose values are the average of both parents' education levels: \n",

    "## Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make scatterplots of each of the varibles versus final grades, to determine whether k-nn or linear regression are suitable and will give use the best results for each variable. If the scatterplot shows something resembling a clear linear trend, we will use linear regression; if not, we will use k-nn regression. Once we have chosen a methods for each variable, we will go ahead with building our regression models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For both types of regression, we will first seperate the data into a testing set and a training set (what do we want the proportions to be? 30/70? 25/75?). We will then set the testing data aside.\n",
    "\n",
    "For linear regression models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create model specification. \n",
    "2) Create recipe.\n",
    "3) Create workflow that integrates model specification and recipe and fits the training data to the workflow.\n",
    "4) Take note of the equation of the line of best fit.\n",
    "5) Graph line of best fit over scatterplot of testing data to visualize relationship.\n",
    "5) Apply the model to the testing data and evaluate the level of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For k-nn regression models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Center and scale predictors (I don't think we need to do this if we only have a single predictor, but the reading says it is still good practice to do it regardless).\n",
    "2) Create model specification.\n",
    "3) Create recipe.\n",
    "4) Peform a vfold (should we do 5? That is how many are in most of the worksheets and readings.).\n",
    "6) Create a workflow that integrates model specification and recipe and fits the training data to the workflow.\n",
    "7) Tune the model to find the best value of k neighbors by filtering the output for the minimum RMSPE value.\n",
    "8) Evaluate the model using the same recipe and model specification, but use the testing data. Take note of the RMSPE value to evaluate level of error. \n",
    "9) Graph results on top of the scatterplot.   "
